# zjovicic.github.io

This is my portfolio website and blog, made at the time when I only knew HTML and CSS. So this is a completely static website.
Still I made sure it looks good and is responsive on all screens. The website contains information about my programming skills,
technologies I work with, examples of my work, as well as a blog where I write about various topics of interest.
The site is online at zjovicic.github.io.
