          />
          <p>
            Here’s a couple of insights I gained over the years while working in
            B2B sales.
          </p>
          <h2>Know your products / production capacities very well.</h2>
          <p>
            You must know all of your products like the back of your hand. You
            have to learn the entire catalogue (almost) by heart. What product
            is used for what and how, its good and bad sides, which products can
            be combined together, what are different subtypes of each product...
            You need to know all this stuff, because only then will you be able
            to continue developing relationships with existing clients, and only
            then will you be able to approach new clients in meaningful ways.
            Otherwise you simply look incompetent and you erode the reputation
            of the entire company.
          </p>
          <h2>Sales is not just about sales and closing the deals.</h2>
          <p>
            It's easy to get obsessed about finding new clients and closing the
            deals. But sales often comprise much more than that. Your principal
            job is to maintain and develop relationships with existing clients.
            This means keeping in touch with the production and/or suppliers to
            make sure the goods are of good quality and ready for shipment when
            promised. This also means trying to sell new products to existing
            clients. When you add a couple of new products to the things you
            sell to a client it's the same thing as if you found a completely
            new client, with the added benefit of the existing relationship.
            Often, the old clients are the best "new" clients (that is, for the
            new products).
          </p>
          <p>
            Making sure the relationships with existing clients are well
            maintained is what ultimately brings bread to the table, and is the
            source of livelihood for your company. While finding a new client is
            always nice, losing an important existing client can be catastrophic
            and should always be avoided.
          </p>
          <p>
            Maintaining good relationships also brings it own rewards: sometimes
            in prices, sometimes in quantities, and sometimes in types of
            collaboration you might never have envisioned.
          </p>
          <h2>Don't underestimate delivery time!</h2>
          <p>
            When you work in sales you often want to close the deal with new
            clients and hence give them an offer that is as attractive as
            possible, to maximize your chances of successful deal. But if this
            means giving unrealistic delivery times that your suppliers and/or
            production can't respect, this is a huge mistake. It's better to err
            on the side of caution and give delivery times a little longer than
            what is actually needed to make sure the production can be done, and
            that there won't be late deliveries. You should be very cautious
            about delivery times, and never underestimate them, even if it means
            not closing the deal and losing a potential new client. This is
            because such a client was probably not worthy of your time to begin
            with, as they are the type of client that would always force you to
            rush when he has an urgency, instead of planning his purchases in
            advance and ordering in such a way that ensures he receives the
            goods regularly, without putting too much pressure on you.
          </p>
          <h2>Spend some time studying the client before approaching them.</h2>
          <p>
            Sometimes it's tempting to use a template e-mail and send the same
            introductory e-mail to countless potential clients. By pure chance
            and the law of large numbers this can work. But it's much better to
            spend at least a couple of minutes studying potential new clients
            before contacting them. This will allow you to know exactly what
            their needs are and which of their problems you can solve with your
            products/services. You can still use the template e-mail, but
            instead of blindly copy/pasting it, you can adjust and personalize
            it, to adress the needs of your potential client. They really like
            it when they see how much effort you made to understand their
            company and their situation, before you reached them. This maximizes
            the chances of establishing a solid relationship from the day zero.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Approach clients by adressing their needs and offering solutions.
          </h2>
          <p>
            As said before, there's no better thing to say in the intro e-mail
            then to talk about your client and their company, and NOT too much
            about your company and products. Your products/services are only
            important insomuch as they can help your client solve their
            problems. If you see that your client is reselling some items
            similar to what your company produces, or that you can produce some
            of the stuff they use or sell, this is the thing you should talk
            about. This is a perfect opportunity to offer them your product
            which they might find more interesting than what they were using
            before.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Find balance between automation and quantity vs. personalization and
            quality
          </h2>
          <p>
            The law of large numbers combined with low-effort template e-mails
            can work. Personalized approach based on studying your clients,
            adjusting intro messages, or calling them directly via phone works
            even better. But it also takes much more time to contact 10 new
            potential clients this way. So what is better? Well, ideally,
            quality is better than quantity and personalized approach is better,
            but there are situations that call for massive e-mail campaigns
            without too much effort for personalization.
          </p>
          <p>
            Typically the higher the probability of closing the deal with a
            potential client, the more detailed and personalized your approach
            should be. You don't want to mess it up when it comes to contacting
            the companies you have serious chances of doing business with.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, if you're looking to enter new markets or try
            producing/selling products outside your usual program, and when the
            chances of establishing relationship are relatively small, you don't
            want to go too slowly or make too much effort when contacting such
            companies. A template e-mail is perfectly fine, and if your intro
            email sits particularly well with certain potential clients (out of
            hundreds you contacted), you still have chance of starting the
            relationship and developing your business.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Fairs are excellent source of information about potential clients
          </h2>
          <p>
            To get to know plenty of potential clients, and to present your
            company in the best possible way, it is a great idea to go visit
            fairs dedicated to your industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            The thing that many people don't know is that you can take some
            advantage of fairs without actually visiting them. Most fairs have
            websites with detailed lists of participants, alongside their short
            descriptions. These lists are gold for you. They can give you basic
            info about countless potential new clients, and what's more, these
            lists are systematic, which allows you too to be systematic in your
            approach to contacting them.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Grab a phone and call the potential clients alongside sending them
            e-mails. It's not either/or. It works best together.
          </h2>
          <p>
            When I send numerous template e-mails to potential clients that are
            relatively low priority, I don't accompany my e-mails with phone
            calls.
          </p>
          <p>
            But when I want to reach out to a potentially serious opportunity, I
            always both call and send an e-mail.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've found the best practice is to first call, introduce yourself,
            try to get to talk to a decision making person, or at least get
            thier e-mail adress (which is much better than sending e-mails to
            info@companyxyz.com), let them know that you'll send an intro
            e-mail, and only then actually send it.
          </p>
          <p>
            When they are expecting an e-mail from you, there's much higher
            probability they'll actually read it and pay attention to it,
            instead of ignoring or deleting it.
          </p>
          <h2>Followup after initial contact is extremely important.</h2>
          <p>
            You can easily get obsessed with contacting as many new clients as
            possible. While the mindset is praiseworthy, such behavior is almost
            always a mistake. If you keep doing it like that, it won't be long
            before you exhaust pretty much the entire pool of potential clients
            you can work with, without getting a proper feedback from them
            (interested/non-interested).
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead you should keep track of whom you contacted and write
            follow-up emails, until you either get a reply from them, or you
            realize that they are not interested.
          </p>
          <p>
            My process was like this: if I send an e-mail today, and they don't
            reply, I send a follow-up email, after 3 working days. The third
            mail one full week after the second one. The fourth e-mail 2-3 weeks
            after the third one.
          </p>
          <p>
            If they don't reply after four e-mails it's relatively safe to
            assume they are not interested.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you didn't call them during the initial approach, you can
            substitute some of the follow-up e-mails with phone calls. Sometimes
            just one phone call is all you need to know whether there's
            potential or not.
          </p>
          <h2>Microsoft Excel can be a decent CRM software.</h2>
          <p>
            People often ask whether they need a CRM. And my answer is yes, you
            need a CRM. Or to be more precise, you must have some system, some
            procedure, some way of monitoring yourself and collecting data about
            potential new clients, as well as existing clients. For this
            purpose, however, you don't always need a complicated CRM software.
            What you need is a basic business software or some ERP that will
            take care of your orders, order confirmations, invoices, client
            database etc. On top of that, especially when it comes to monitoring
            your dealing with potential new clients, sometimes all you need is a
            couple of cleverly designed Microsoft Excel workbooks, which can
            often accomplish pretty much the same thing as CRM, while giving you
            much more flexibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remeber, you must use them consistently and in a disciplined fashion
            for it to be useful. Otherwise, it's quite easy to lose track of the
            status of your situation with potential new clients.
          </p>
          <h2>Don’t let emotions get the better of you</h2>
          <p>
            Perpahs the most important thing in sales is to not let the emotions
            control you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your job is to always do the right thing and do your job properly,
            and you must not let emotions compromise your decision making
            abilities.
          </p>
          <p>In practice this typically means the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Don't lower the price too much, even if sales figures are going
              down and even if the management is pressuring you to sell.
            </li>
            <li>
              Don't promise too fast / unrealistic shipment times even if the
              client insists!
            </li>
            <li>
              Don't do stupid things, just to impress the management (or out of
              fear they'll do something if you don't). Typical example of
              "stupid things" is wasting time contacting prospects that are 0
              chance of success, just to improve your numbers, and to be able to
              tell the boss how many new prospects you contacted.
            </li>
            <li>
              Keep boundaries of your work. Take full responsibility for what IS
              your job, don't mess with the stuff that are NOT your job (unless
              asked by boss), and don't let other people (except your
              supervisor) mess with your job.
            </li>
          </ul>
