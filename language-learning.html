          <h1>Language Learning Strategies</h1>
          <img src="pictures/langauge.png" alt="Languages stock photo" />
          <p>
            To learn a foreign language, there are two main approaches. The
            first is to enroll in some official course, to attend classes and
            complete levels, until you reach your desired level.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second approach is to design and plan your own path, based
            predominately on studying on your own.
          </p>
          <p>
            Which one of these paths is the right for you, depends mostly on
            your situation.
          </p>
          <p>Official course might be the best option for you if:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You don’t have much experience learning languages on your own
            </li>
            <li>
              Your knowlege of grammar and structure of languages in general is
              limited
            </li>
            <li>You're not in a rush to learn the language</li>
            <li>
              You want not just to learn a language but to socialize and meet
              new people
            </li>
            <li>You don’t mind paying for the course</li>
            <li>
              You want to be able to work directly with the teacher to resolve
              any doubts you might have
            </li>
            <li>You’re not frustrated by slow progress</li>
            <li>You don’t have a lot of time each day for studying</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Self study is a riskier approach, but potentially way more
            efficient. It is probably the best option for you if:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>You have some experience learning languages already</li>
            <li>
              You understand intuitively how languages work, and their grammar
              system
            </li>
            <li>You want to be in control of your own study</li>
            <li>
              You want to have a clear orientation and to know at any moment
              where exactly you are in the learning process (which phase you’re
              in, what you’ve covered so far, and what remains to be covered)
            </li>
            <li>
              You want to learn as much of the language as poissible as quickly
              as possible
            </li>
            <li>You find yourself conforable as an independent learner</li>
            <li>You can dedicate plenty of time each day to your studies</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Now, if you choose the second option, here’s my quick outline of the
            whole process. At least this approach worked for me.
          </p>
          <h2>My framework for self-study of languages</h2>
          <h3>
            Phase 1 – Get infromed ABOUT the language before starting the
            process
          </h3>
          <p>
            This can mean as little as reading Wikipedia article about your
            target language. The point is to get some basic info about the
            grammar of that language, what kinds of stuff you have to learn,
            which group of languages it belongs to, what the main challanges and
            difficulties you’re going to face in the learning process are. You
            can also do some research on the Internet, especially on various
            language learning forums. This will allow you to draw a mental map
            of the journey ahead of you, so you can prepare for it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having such a map, will help you in all the subsequent phases of the
            language learning process, and will allow you to always be oriented,
            and to never get lost.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Phase 2 – As quickly as possible learn basics of grammar and 2000
            most common words
          </h3>
          <p>
            In the world of startups it’s called “Minimum Viable Product”. Once
            you know basics of grammar (for example, noun declension and most
            frequently used tenses), and 2000 most commonly used words, you can,
            albeit with difficulty, already use the language somewhat
            competently. Even if you encounter a completely unknown text, you’ll
            recognize grammatical structures you studied and words you learned.
            You’ll get some basic understanding. You can learn the most common
            words from sources such as phrasebooks, picture dictionaries, or
            even frequency lists that list the most common words in the order of
            frequency. When it comes to grammar, try to get a good textbook, for
            example something aimed at first year University students who study
            your target language, and you can study the grammar like any other
            school subject, as if you were preparing for an exam.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can learn pretty much all the grammar (except some really exotic
            aspects) of almost any language, and 2000 most frequent words in as
            little as 2 months, if you spend many hours a day studying.
          </p>
          <p>
            After that process you’ll have all of that studied and memorized,
            but not yet really assimilated, so in spite of your knowledge,
            you’ll find it very difficult to practically use what you learned.
          </p>
          <p>
            Don’t despair, this is perfectly normal. Assimilation process starts
            in the phase 3.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Phase 3 – Get as much comprehensible input as possible in your
            target language
          </h3>
          <p>
            Once you have your grammar and 2000 most frequent words under your
            belt. You can start navigating the unexplored ocean of texts in your
            target language. At this point it’s important that you read and
            listen as much materials in your target language as possible. Try to
            choose a level that’s a bit hard for you to understand but not too
            hard. You can grab some books for children, short stories, jokes.
            You can find plenty of Youtube channels with comprehensible input
            aimed at different levels of skill. Spend some time in this phase
            without too much worry, until you assimilate a solid bunch of
            language, and until the structures start really engraving themselves
            deeply into your mind. All the knowledge you gained in the second
            phase will now be assimilated, and also broadened with plenty of new
            words and grammatical structures that you directly learn and
            assimilate from the context. I’d spend around 2-3 months in that
            phase before progressing further.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Phase 4 – Start using the language actively, get feedback, possibly
            a tutor
          </h3>
          <p>
            At this point you can start making your first attempts to use the
            language in writing and speaking. Start using the forums in the
            target language. The point is that you accomplish your communicative
            goals, that is to get your message across, and to get back the
            answers from the other users. Many of them will be happy to correct
            your errors and to encourage you in your efforts. At that point,
            you’re around strong A2, approaching B1 level. At that point it
            would be wise to get a tutor, which you can also find online on
            sites such as <a href="https://www.italki.com/">Italki</a>. With
            them you can start practicing spoken conversation, and they will
            also help you correct your typical mistakes. At this phase it’s
            quite important to pay attention to mistakes that you make, so that
            you can correct them before they become too stubborn and too deeply
            entranched in your mind...
          </p>
          <h3>
            Phase 5 – Keep getting lots of input + actively using the language
          </h3>
          <p>
            This is a never ending phase. You need to stay in contact with the
            language to keep it fresh in your mind. Once you’ve solidified your
            knowledge and got rid of the errors, the only thing that remains is
            to keep using the language and even more importantly keep getting
            input in that language. This way your vocabulary will continue to
            grow and your skills will become more and more automatic and
            solidified. The good news is that once you reach a certain
            relatively high level in language, it becomes harder to forget it.
            On the other hand languages that we only learn to a low or
            low-intermediate level, can quickly fade if we don’t use them. So
            it’s a good idea to stay in active contact with the language for as
            long as possible, to make it a stable feature of your mind, and a
            stable skill that you have.
